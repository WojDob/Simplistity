# Simplistity
A to-do list that's simple. Inspired by <a href="http://todotxt.org">todo.txt</a>, developed in C#.

This desktop application allows you to add tasks to a simple and minimalistic to-do list, with a functionality to set a due date, set a priority, and archive the checked tasks which will then appear in a separate file called done.txt
